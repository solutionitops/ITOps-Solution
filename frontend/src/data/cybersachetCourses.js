// Real CyberSachet curriculum, authored once here and consumed two ways:
//   1. Locally, right now, via the `local*` functions below (localStorage-
//      backed enroll/progress/quiz — no database required).
//   2. Later, as a Supabase seed — see supabase/migrations/0040 (content),
//      0042/0043 (per-lesson comprehension checks), and 0045 (modules,
//      categories, free-tier flag, key takeaways, and the two new question
//      types) — the exact same shape. Once applied and an org is licensed,
//      CyberSachetTraining.jsx switches to the real RPCs automatically —
//      this file becomes dead code, not a rewrite.
//
// Field names intentionally match what the real endpoints return (see
// api/endpoints.js) so the exact same UI components render both.
//
// Every lesson carries a one-question comprehension check
// (`check: {question, choices, correctIndex}`) — completing a lesson
// requires answering it correctly; getLocalLessons() strips correctIndex
// before handing lessons to the UI (mirroring the boundary list_course_quiz()
// enforces server-side) so the answer can't be read from devtools —
// verification happens inside localCheckLessonAnswer() below.
//
// Quiz questions support three types, matching migration 0045:
//   single   -> correctIndex (an int)
//   multiple -> correctIndexes (int[], graded as a set — order doesn't matter)
//   ordering -> correctOrder (int[], the right sequence of choice indexes —
//               order matters completely)

        body: "For years, the standard way to ship software was: a developer writes code, it works on their machine, then it gets deployed to a server with a different OS version, different library versions, different everything — and it breaks. This is the classic \"works on my machine\" problem, and it turned every deployment into a debugging session. The old model looked like: Developer writes code → hands it to Ops → Ops fights server differences → application finally runs, maybe. Containers collapse that chain: Developer writes code → packages it with every dependency it needs into a container image → that exact same image runs identically on a laptop, a test server, and production, because the container carries its own filesystem and dependencies with it. Netflix, Spotify, and most large tech companies run thousands of services this way specifically because it removes environment drift as a category of bug entirely — not because containers are trendy, but because \"it works in the image\" is a guarantee \"it works on my machine\" never was.",

The tradeoff: a VM can run a completely different OS than its host; a Linux container needs a Linux kernel underneath (which is why Docker on Mac/Windows quietly runs a small Linux VM to host the containers). For most application deployment, containers win on speed and density — running far more containers than VMs on the same hardware — which is why they became the default unit of deployment for modern applications.",

LXC (Linux Containers, 2008) added namespaces and cgroups for real isolation and resource limits — the same kernel features Docker still uses today. What Docker actually invented in 2013 wasn't the isolation technology; it was the developer experience: a simple CLI, a shareable image format, and Docker Hub as a place to publish and pull images — turning a kernel feature only specialists used into something any developer could use in an afternoon. That popularity created a problem: everyone building container tooling risked locking users into one vendor's image format. The Open Container Initiative (OCI) standardized the image format and runtime spec in 2015, so an image built with Docker can run under containerd, CRI-O, or Podman without changes. This is why Kubernetes doesn't actually depend on Docker itself anymore — it runs OCI-compliant containers through containerd directly.",

A Service solves this: it's a stable virtual IP and DNS name that load-balances traffic across every currently-running Pod matching a label selector, updating automatically as Pods come and go. ClusterIP (the default) is only reachable from inside the cluster — for internal service-to-service traffic. NodePort opens a port on every node for external access, mostly used for testing.
